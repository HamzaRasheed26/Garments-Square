# Garments-Square
The project is a user-friendly desktop application. It deals with managing the product distribution for the apparel company. This project has two users: employees, and riders. The project contains a single class of employee. It provides UI to riders to manage orders. Riders get orders from the shopkeeper and then give them to the employee. After receiving the order from the rider, the employee is capable of either declining the order or fulfilling the order. If an employee chooses to deliver an order right away, his next task is to notify the shopkeeper via mail that the order should be delivered the following day.
